# MyOverview

Hi!
I'm Damian, and I'm a software tester. 

I conduct manual functional tests, assess performance, usability and prepare test scenarios for user acceptance tests.
I also write and maintain automated tests.

In my repositories you can find code I wrote during courses or from my private projects.
